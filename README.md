# Successor Representation with a Wave-like Update Rule

This algorithm emerged from my Master's Degree project at KTH Royal Institute of Technology during the Spring of 2021.

The thesis can be found here: https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1607324

I am grateful for the guidance I received from my supervisors Dr. Arvind Kumar and Emil WÃ¤rnberg.
